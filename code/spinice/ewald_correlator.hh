/* Class ewald_correlator: calculates spin correlators and Ewald summed energies
 *                         using a FT representation of the potential components
 * Life cycle:
 *     fill with real space interaction energies, Fourier transform and store
 *     input Ising spins on sublattices, Fourier transform them
 *     energy calculations can be done by
 *         E = 1/(2N) sum_{q,a,b} V_ab(q) sigma_a(q) sigma_b*(q)
 *     where N is number of FCC unit cells (i.e., 2N is what is called N in code)
 *     correlator calculations are done in terms of Fourier transformed spins
 *         (should only need Ising spin correlators by lattices)
 *
 * NB Potential terms stored in V_ab(q) correspond to real space potentials
 *    V_ab(r) between spins at R_pyro(a) and r+R_pyro(b)
